âœ… Primary Jet Fuels Used in Commercial Aviation:
1. Jet A
Used in: Primarily the United States
Freezing point: -40Â°C
Flash point: ~38Â°C
Application: Domestic U.S. commercial flights
Aircraft: Boeing 737, 777, 787; Airbus A320, A350; Embraer E-Jets, etc.

2. Jet A-1
Used in: Internationally (Europe, Asia, Australia, Latin America, etc.)
Freezing point: -47Â°C (better suited for long-haul and high-altitude flights)
Flash point: ~38Â°C
Application: Global standard for international and intercontinental commercial aviation
Aircraft: Same as above â€” all major commercial jets

ðŸ”„ What's the difference?
Jet A vs. Jet A-1: They are nearly identical, but Jet A-1 has a lower freezing point, making it better for long-haul or high-altitude international routes.
Airlines will refuel based on availability at airports â€” e.g., a U.S. airline flying internationally will often use Jet A-1 outside the U.S.

ðŸŒ¿ Bonus: Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF)
Type: Biofuels or synthetic paraffinic kerosene
Blended with: Jet A/Jet A-1 up to 50%
Used by: Airlines like United, Lufthansa, KLM, and British Airways are already using SAF on some flights
Purpose: Reduce carbon footprint and reliance on fossil fuels
